    "content": "<p>The Mekong Delta is Vietnam’s agricultural heartland, yet also one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change. Saltwater intrusion, rising sea levels, and declining soil health threaten the sustainability of food and farming systems across the region.</p><p>The project <strong>STAR-FARM</strong> (Smart Agro-ecological Transformation of Farming Systems towards Resilience and Sustainability in Middle and Coastal Zones of the Viet Nam Mekong Delta) was initiated to support the ecological transformation of agricultural systems in the region. It is jointly implemented by <strong>IRD</strong>, <strong>CIRAD</strong>, and <strong>FAO</strong>, with technical support from the <strong>GEF-7 FOLUR</strong> program and experience drawn from related projects such as <strong>ASSET</strong> and <strong>GEF-7 Mekong</strong>.</p>"

    "title": "Approach",
    "content": "<p>The project adopts an integrated multi-level approach built on three pillars:</p><h4>Developing Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)</h4><p>A set of <strong>10 core sustainability indicators</strong>, adapted from FAO’s <em>TAPE</em> framework, will be used to assess ecological and socio-economic outcomes. These include:</p><ol><li>Secure land tenure</li><li>Productivity</li><li>Income</li><li>Value-added</li><li>Pesticide exposure</li><li>Dietary diversity</li><li>Women’s empowerment</li><li>Youth employment</li><li>Agricultural biodiversity</li><li>Soil health</li></ol><h4>Multi-scale Data Collection and Monitoring</h4><p>Environmental, social, and economic data will be collected across multiple levels—household, provincial, regional, and national—using a combination of remote sensing (e.g., Sentinel-1), field surveys, national statistics, and participatory tools.</p><h4>Cloud-based Monitoring and Knowledge Systems</h4><p>The project will implement a cloud-based <strong>Knowledge Management System (KMS)</strong> integrating these KPIs, alongside tools like <code>@biofunctool</code>, soil macrofauna studies, and crop simulation models to monitor sustainability, productivity, water use, and greenhouse gas emissions.</p>"
